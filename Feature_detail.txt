DESCRIPTION OF THE FEATURES USED IN THE PROJECT
------------------------------------------------

Relative Strength Index (RSI)
-------------------------------

The relative strength (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis 
that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or 
oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset.
The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between 
two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100. The indicator was originally 
developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book, 
“New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.”

Bollinger Bands®
(BB_high, BB_low)
-------------------------------------

A Bollinger Band® is a technical analysis tool defined by a set of trendlines
plotted two standard deviations (positively and negatively) away from a 
simple moving average (SMA) of a security's price, but which can be adjusted to 
user preferences. Bollinger Bands® were developed and copyrighted by 
famous technical trader John Bollinger, designed to discover opportunities that 
give investors a higher probability of properly identifying when an asset is 
oversold or overbought.

Average True Range (ATR)
-------------------------------------

The average true range (ATR) is a technical analysis indicator, introduced by 
market technician J. Welles Wilder Jr. in his book New Concepts in 
Technical Trading Systems, that measures market volatility by decomposing the 
entire range of an asset price for that period. The true range indicator is 
taken as the greatest of the following: current high less the current low; the 
absolute value of the current high less the previous close; and the absolute 
value of the current low less the previous close. The ATR is then a 
moving average, generally using 14 days, of the true ranges. 
The ATR was originally developed for use in commodities markets but has since 
been applied to all types of securities.

Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
--------------------------------------------------

Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following 
momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a
security’s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period 
exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.
The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD 
called the "signal line," is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can 
function as a trigger for buy and sell signals.

Stochastic Oscillator(STOCH)
--------------------------------------------------

A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing 
price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time. 
The sensitivity of the oscillator to market movements is reducible by adjusting 
that time period or by taking a moving average of the result. It is used to 
generate overbought and oversold trading signals, utilizing a 0–100 bounded 
range of values.

Average Directional Index (ADX)
------------------------------------------------------

The average directional index (ADX) is used to determine when the price is 
trending strongly.  ADX is used to quantify trend strength. ADX calculations are
based on a moving average of price range expansion over a given period of time. 
The default setting is 14 bars, although other time periods can be used. ADX can
be used on any trading vehicle such as stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded
funds and futures. ADX is plotted as a single line with values ranging from a
low of zero to a high of 100.

Directional Movement Index (DMI)
(DI_PLUS, DI_MINUS)
-----------------------------------------------------

The directional movement index (DMI) is an indicator developed by
J. Welles Wilder in 1978 that identifies in which direction the price of an
asset is moving. The indicator does this by comparing prior highs and lows and 
drawing two lines: a positive directional movement line (+DI) and a
negative directional movement line (-DI). An optional third line, called
the average directional index (ADX), can also be used to gauge the
strength of the uptrend or downtrend.

Returns
(return_1d, return_7d, return_14d, return_30d,return_60d, return_90d)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Historical returns calculated for various time periods from the daily close 
prices. They measure the change in price for the given time period. Periods in
this dataset are daily periods and include returns
over 1, 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 days. They are chosen to match up roughly with
basic trading cycles for cryptocurrency, which can be traded 24/7.
The change is expressed as a percentage and is calculate
using pandas .pct_change() method.  

Lagged Returns
(return_1d_lagX - return_90d_lagX)
---------------------------------------------

“Returns from previous time periods meant to train a model to learn return
patterns in the hope of predicting future returns. To capture the price trend 
for various historical lags, the corresponding returns for the lag period are
calculated and then transformed into the daily geometric mean. The lag periods
match the ones for the historical returns above. Here, the Lagged Returns values
are also clipped at the 0.01st and the 99.99th percentile. The returns are then
“moved up” to the “present” using pandas .shift() method.”

Target Forward Returns
--------------------------------

These will serve as the target “y” values for the model. These will test the
predictions for various “future” periods. To simulate this, the returns are
shifted backwards by their respective time periods with pandas .shift(),
simulating a “target” return to test against. “The goal is to identify the
holding period that produces the best predictive accuracy, as measured by the
Information Coefficient (IC).”

year_XXX - month_X
-------------------------------------

These are time indicator variables and are dummy encoded, so that they can be
processed by a model. Their presence is meant to capture any “seasonal effects”
and changing market conditions more broadly.


Principal_component_1 - 6
--------------------------------------

These are used in place of “known risk factors” such as Fama-French factors,
which can’t be readily adapted to cryptocurrency without full blockchain
transaction data (TX) for every cryptocurrency in the dataset. 
Instead of “known risk factors”, this project makes use of “data driven”
risk factors. These are the top 6 factors, which taken together “explain”
over 70% of all the returns, according to PCA(), using default parameters.
The factors were used to generate “factor betas”, which are used as features
herein, intended to quantify the amount of risk exposure in a portfolio 
(the pool of cryptocurrencies in this case) to the factors found by PCA().
This could potentially also measure how much the risk is “worth” according to
the market by indicating how large the returns could theoretically be, and how
much of the returns are coming from unknown sources, that is, not driven by
these 6 factors.
